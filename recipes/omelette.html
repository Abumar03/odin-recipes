    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A true French omelette is just eggs and butter, no filling. The egg is folded for a soft, tender texture.</p>
    <p>The technique does take a bit of practice to perfect but you'll be amazed at just how delicious these few ingredients can be when elevated using this method.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large fresh eggs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cold water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, water, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Whisk until mixture is very liquid and whites are completely blended in, 1 or 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Using the spatula, smooth the surface to move runny eggs to less runny spots, working toward an even thickness. As soon as the surface is wet but not runny, remove from heat. </li>
    </ol>
