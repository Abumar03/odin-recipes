    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is comfort food at its finest, layered with ground beef, Italian sausage, and cheese.</p>
    <p>Home cooks love how flexible this lasagna is — some even opt to substitute zucchini for noodles.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>4 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cook ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; drain. Stir in tomato sauce, mushrooms, garlic salt, oregano, thyme, and basil; season with salt and black pepper. Simmer 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles with olive oil in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
